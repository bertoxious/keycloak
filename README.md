### What is __Keycloak__ ?
It is a tool for __â€œIdentity and Access Management__. Additionally, Keycloak is an open-source tool currently licensed with Apache License 2.0. It is also an upstream project for Red Hat SSO, so if you are looking for something more enterprise-centered, you can check it. IAM typically aims to verify the identity of a user or system which is requesting access to your environment, and evaluates a set of rules which tells what features and assets is that user/system has access to.
